# INFO2950_project
This is the final project of the course INFO 2950. We are still currently in the introductory phases (Phase I). After Phase I, we have narrowed down to three main datasets â€” Crime in the United States By State Over the Years, Population Change Over the Years By Location, and Residential Real Estate Demand Across Different States and Cities of the United States. From here, we plan to choose one of these ideas/datasets and expand upon it, while developing our project with a defined research question and exploring further with applicable data visualization and statistics (Phase II).
