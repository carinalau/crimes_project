# Predicting Violent Crime Rates Across U.S. States
This project explores the factors influencing violent crime rates across U.S. states. Using datasets that include crime statistics, population demographics, and socioeconomic indicators. This project was completed as part of INFO 2950: Introduction to Data Science at Cornell University, where it received a final grade of 93/100. The goal was to predict violent crime rates across U.S. states using factors such as unemployment rate, income, poverty, and population.

## Overview
We analyzed publicly available datasets containing crime statistics, population demographics, and socioeconomic indicators. The project involved data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and predictive modeling to uncover patterns and make accurate predictions.

## Features
- Data Exploration: Visualization and analysis of crime and socioeconomic data across states.
- Predictive Modeling: Building and evaluating models to predict violent crime rates.
- Hypothesis Testing: Evaluating statistically significant relationships that relate to the research question.
- Insights: Understanding the relationships between crime and factors like income, poverty, unemployment, and population.

## Tools and Technologies
- Languages: Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Libraries: Statsmodels, Plotly
