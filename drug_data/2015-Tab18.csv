"NOTE: The generalized correlations were calculated as an average of seven sets of correlations using 2002, 2003, and 2007-2014 NSDUH data. For more information on how these correlations were produced and how they can be used, see the accompanying methodology.    ",,,,,,
"The correlations for the Total U.S. row are set to zero because design-based estimates are published for the Total U.S. row, and these design-based estimates are uncorrelated when the samples do not overlap.",,,,,,
"NOTE: The column labeled ""Order"" can be used to sort the data to the original sort order.",,,,,,
